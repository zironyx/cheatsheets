# Complex numbers

## imaginary number

- $x^2 = -1$ it is **impossible to square a real number and get a negative number**
- However, a solution does exist in a new number system called the **complex number system**

### imaginary unit

- $i = sqrt(-1)$ is an imaginary unit
  > The previously unsolvable equation is now solvable. $x = i$

### Pure imaginary numbers

- A complex number that has no real part

### powers of i

| $i^0$ | $i^1$ | $i^2$ | $i^3$ | $i^4$ | $i^5$ | $i^6$ | $i^7$ | ... |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| 1     | i     | -1    | -i    | 1     | i     | -1    | -i    | ... |

## Complex numbers

- Real numbers + imaginary unit
- Eg: 5 + 4i
- A Complex number is a point in a 2D Plane where Real part is x, imaginary is y
